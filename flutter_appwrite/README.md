# üîñ Todo With Flutter 

A simple todo app built with Flutter and Appwrite

## üé¨ Getting Started

Appwrite is an end-to-end backend server for Web, Mobile, Native, or Backend apps packaged as a set of Docker microservices. Appwrite abstracts the complexity and repetitiveness required to build a modern backend API from scratch and allows you to build secure apps faster.

### ü§ò Install Appwrite

Follow our simple [Installation Guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation) to get Appwrite up and running in no time. You can either deploy Appwrite on your local machine or, on any cloud provider of your choice.

    Note: If you setup Appwrite on your local machine, you will need to create a public IP so that your hosted frontend 
    can access it.

We need to make a few configuration changes to your Appwrite server.

1. Add a new Flutter App (Android or iOS or any supported platform) in Appwrite and enter application id of your application (io.appwrite.todo, etc)

2. Create a new database then inside it create a new collection with the following properties

  - Rules

Add the following rules to the collection.

    Make sure that your key exactly matches the key in the images

- Permissions

Add the following permissions to your collections. These permissions ensure that only registered users can access the collection.

Create new placeholder user, with the following info:
User ID: 133
Email: guest@temp.com
Password: 12345678

## üöÄ Deploy the Front End

You have two options to deploy the front-end and we will cover both of them here. In either case, you will need to fill in these environment variables that help your frontend connect to Appwrite.

    FLUTTER_APP_ENDPOINT - Your Appwrite endpoint
    FLUTTER_APP_PROJECT - Your Appwrite project ID
    FLUTTER_APP_COLLECTION_ID - Your Appwrite collection ID
  
## Run locally

Follow these instructions to run the demo app locally

$ git clone https://github.com/MrWael/demo-todo-with-flutter3.git
$ cd demo-todo-with-flutter3

Make a one file in the Clone Repo called constant.dart

    class AppConstant {
    static const String projectid = '[PROJECTID]';
    static const String endPoint = 'https://[SERVERIPADDRESS]/v1';
    static const String database = '[DATABASEID]';
    static const String collection = '[COLLECTIONID]';
    static const String profileImgBucketId = '[BUCKETID]';
    }


Now run the following commands and you should be good to go üí™üèº

$ flutter pub get
$ flutter run


## Features

1. User can Login and Signup the app.
2. User can add, update the profile picture.
